# Second language acquisition/learning
Yule starts this chapter with an explanation of what word 'bilingual' means. The author brings up an example of children growing up in an environment with more than one language used. Thus, such children are able to acquire their second language similarly to the first one.

## Second language learning
Yule refers to the issue of why one can learn better at a very young age in comparison too being thirteen years old as 'enigma'. The term Second Language Learning might be understood in two ways: some describe it as learning a 'foreign language' that is not spoken in one's closest environment (ESL), on the other hand, a second language is claimed to be a language spoken in the closest environment (ESL). 
### Acquisition and learning
Acquisition and learning are terms that can be strictly divided. Acquisition, according to Yule, is a process of gradual development in language by its natural usage. Moreover, it is present without help of a teacher. However, when it comes to learning, it is connected with a conscious action (or process) of expanding knowledge. Learning is typically visible in schools.
What is more, Yule claims that the traditional way of learning includes more knowledge considering the theory about language and not knowing about how to use it. People who acquired L2 in this traditional way of learning tend to be less effective in their language skills in comparison to those who acquired L2 in more ‘natural’ circumstances.
### Acquisition barriers
The author introduces this issue explaining that most people’s experience with L2 begins in school when they have already acquired and got used to the sound structures of their L1. This problem might be demotivating for many but some of such learners, with enough commitment, develop their L2 skills. However, it is highly probable that they still will not resemble native speakers. The issue of having an ‘accent’, as Yule mentions, is common also for people that acquired L2 in perfect environments.
