# First Language Acquisition
### The Acquisition Schedule 
A child's broad linguistic capacity must be brought into contact with a specific language such as English throughout the first two or three years of growth. What is also important is the significance of **cultural transmission**, which means that a child's language skills are acquired in a specific language-using context rather than being genetically inherited. A child must be able to hear a language in order to speak it.
#### Input
Human newborns are undoubtedly aided in their language learning under normal conditions by the ordinary conduct of older children and adults in the home setting who give language samples, or input. The typical simplified speech style adopted by people who spend a lot of time interacting with young children includes many forms related to **"baby talk"**. These are simplified words or alternative forms that repeat simple sounds and syllables. They are used for things in children’s environments. Another characteristic of this style of speaking is **frequent use problems**. Usually the intonation is exaggerated, the volume is louder, and the longer the rhythm, the slower the rhythm. The frequent use of questions, as well as increased intonation, additional loudness, and a slower pace with lengthier pauses, characterize this speech style. This style is also known as "caregiver speech" and is often referred to as **"motherese"** or **"child-directed speech."**
#### Caregiver speech
A conversational framework that appears to assign an interactive role to the young kid even before he or she becomes a verbal participant is built into a lot of caregiver speech. This sort of structure becomes obvious when we look at an excerpt from a mother's speech to her child as if it were a two-party discussion. If the kid is developing a system for combining sounds and words, the simpler models created by the engaging adult may provide **useful insights** to the basic structural organization involved.
### The Acquisition Schedule 
Normally, children learn to speak at around the same period and follow a similar pattern. They have been actively absorbing what they hear long before they start to speak. The way they increase or reduce **"sucking behaviour"** in reaction to speech sounds or shift their heads in the direction of those sounds can help us figure out what very young toddlers are paying attention to. **During the first three months**, the kid responds to a speaking face with large smiles and begins to make distinct vocalizations.
#### Cooing
**Cooing** has been described as the earliest use of speech-like noises. The kid gradually gains the ability to produce sequences of vowel-like sounds, particularly high vowels, throughout the first few months of life.
By four months of age, the child's growing ability to bring the back of the tongue into consistent contact with the back of the palate allows the infant to produce sounds comparable to velar consonants and, therefore the frequent description of "cooing" or "gooing" for this sort of output. According to research, infants can hear the difference between vowels and differentiate between syllables **by the age of five months**.
#### Babbling
Between the ages of six and eight months, the kid is sitting up and generating a variety of vowels and consonants. **Babbling** is a term used to characterize this sort of sound creation. Because adults react to babble as if it were the kid's contribution to social engagement, this **"pre-language" use of sound** gives the infant some experience with the  social role of speech.
#### The One-Word Stage 
Children begin to make a range of identifiable single-unit utterances **between the ages of twelve and eighteen months**. The one-word stage, as it is known, is characterized by speech in which single phrases are employed for things. The term **holophrastic speech** refers to an utterance that can be a word, a phrase, or a sentence. Although, holographic expressions seem to be used to name objects, they may also appear in situations that indicate that children are already expanding their use. 
#### The Two-Word Stage
The two-word stage can begin as early as **eighteen to twenty months**, depending on what we consider an incidence of two different words used simultaneously. Regardless of what the child is actually trying to communicate through this form of expression, the important functional consequence is that adults or older children behave as if they are communicating. In other words, the kid not only makes speech, but also receives feedback indicating that the utterance was successful as a contribution to the engagement.
#### Telegraphic Speech
Between the ages of two and two and a half, the kid begins to produce a considerable number of utterances that may be classed as **"multiple-word"** speech. At this stage, the kid has obviously established some sentence-building skills and can correctly organize words. By the age of two and a half, the child's language has grown significantly, and he or she can initate more conversations. At this stage, it is important to evaluate what type of effect adults have on the development of the child's speech.
### The Acquisition Process
Although it is a common belief that children are taught a given language, the child’s production of utterances seems to be majorly relying on the child’s experimentation with language rather than the adult’s instructions. 
Research suggests that children do not learn through the process of imitating or through **corrections** given by adults. In fact, one of the most vital elements of the child’s acquisition process is the use of both word combinations and sounds. Additionally, wordplay appears to be a crucial factor in the development of the child's language repertoire.
### Developing morphology
Once children move beyond [telegraphic speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphic_speech), they begin to integrate morphemes (inflectional and functional) into their speech patterns. 
While at first the -*ing* expressions and prepositions are employed, the next stage is related to the use of plurals. This stage is associated with **overgeneralization**, the process of applying a grammatical rule in cases where it doesn't apply (e.g. *foots*). The acquisition process adheres to the following scheme: the -*ing* form, prepositions, plural *-s*, irregular past tense, possessive *-s*, to *be*, articles, past tense, and present tense. The following table (Yule 2020, p. 208) presents the gradual acquisition of morphemes:
| Stage 	|       Morpheme       	|    Examples   	|
|:-----:	|:--------------------:	|:-------------:	|
| 1     	| -ing                 	| mommy reading 	|
| 2     	| in                   	| not in that   	|
| 3     	| on                   	| on bed        	|
| 4     	| plural -s            	| cats          	|
| 5     	| irregular past tense 	| he came       	|
| 6     	| possessive -s        	| mommy's book  	|
| 7     	| verb 'to be'         	| this is no    	|
| 8     	| articles             	| a cat         	|
| 9     	| past tense -ed       	| it opened     	|
| 10    	| present tense -s     	| it comes      	|

### Developing syntax
While looking at the initial production of syntax in the child’s speech, questions and negatives are structures acquired systematically. When it comes to forming both of the aforementioned structures, the pattern of acquisition commonly observes the following scheme: **Stage 1** (18-26 months), **Stage 2** (22 and 30 months), and **Stage 3** (24-40 months).
#### Forming questions
In the **first stage**, questions are formed with *wh*-forms added to the beginning of a sentence (e.g. *Where kitty?*) While in the **second stage** more *wh*-forms and more elaborate structures are used by a child, within the **third stage** the inversion of auxiliary verbs occurs.
#### Forming negatives
In the **first stage**, negatives are formed by adding *no* or *not* at the beginning of a sentence. In the **second stage**, on the other hand, the child appears to start using the form *don’t*. 
Lastly, in the **third stage**, the child begins to add *didn’t* and *won’t* to verbs to form negatives.
### Developing semantics
Even though the process of giving meaning to certain words by children is somewhat unclear, the most recognizable process appears to be overextension. **Overextension** is the use of a single word to label multiple different things which are seen as not necessarily connected (e.g. *fly* denoting an *insect* and *dirt*). At the same time, the child can recognize differences between objects.
As far as **hyponymy** is concerned, children tend to choose the middle term rather than the most general one (e.g. a *dog* rather than an *animal*).
### Later Developments
The later stages of acquisition involve learning to distinguish between the antonymous pairs of words such as *before*/*after*. Similarly, the ability to employ more complex syntactic structures as well as **extended discourse** come later in the child's development.
Once a child reaches the **age of five**, the major part of the language acquisition process seems to be finalized. Thus, at this point in the development, children grow into competent language users. However, there remains the question of why the L2 learning process poses such a challenge given that first language acquisition occurs naturally.
